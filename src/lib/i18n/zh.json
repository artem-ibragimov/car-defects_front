The problem is that all of these reviews are subjective, and if you are a rational mature person, and reliability of a car in the long term is important for you, you may be interested in analysis of call statistics service.\n\nThere are awesome sites such as carcomplaints.com, carproblemzoo.com, nhtsa.gov, where people describe problems encountered during the period of their car exploitation. But unfortunately there are no charts on these sites, so you can't visually compare different models and figure out which is more problematic.\n\nthat's why I’ve created my own website car-defects.com, collecting all the information from these useful resources and presenting it as graphs. Here you can compare car models, model generations and versions, visualize by age or mileage, and, for objectivity, consider normalized data i.e. the number of crashes per 10,000 cars sold. The site has information about 4 million crashes, and you can also contribute to the project by sharing your own experience.\n\nIt's a non-commercial project, created on a voluntary basis, and it is still on alpha release."

But let’s be absolutely objective here the statistics of car service calls aren't pretty: Compared with concurrents, Honda owners have problems with CVT two times more often than others in the first three years of use.\n\nOf course, a CVT car is more dynamic and fuel-efficient, but if car reliability is important to you, You'd be better off taking a classic automatic transmission."

The new A4 has achieved great results thanks to its engines, which are sourced from the Volkswagen Audi Group.\n\nAlmost the same positive results about transmission: In the B8 generation, A4 was equipped with old-school Multitronic CVT, S tronic, and Tiptronic automatics as well as manual transmissions, but the sharper, quicker S-tronic twin-clutch arrangement is now the sole self-shifting option."

				"title": "How Repair Costs Change As Subaru Models Age",
				"text": "Subaru has earned a reputation for reliability, but even their vehicles require repairs as the odometer accumulates miles. Tracking service costs by mileage provides insight into which models remain affordable to maintain.\n\nThe Subaru Ascent midsize SUV averages around $350 yearly in repairs during the first 50,000 miles. From 50,000 to 100,000 miles, this rises to $400 annually, and beyond 100,000 miles costs reach about $475.\n\nThe B9 Tribeca midsize SUV follows a similar pattern. In the first 50,000 miles, owners report spending roughly $300 per year on unscheduled repairs. From 50,000 to 100,000 miles this increases to $375, and after 100,000 miles jumps to $450. \n\nOur car service call statistics data show that Ascent had more defects than Tribeca (almost double)\n\nOn the other hand, the Baja compact pickup displays a relatively comparable trend. For the first 50,000 miles, drivers pay approximately $250 yearly for repairs. Baja has the lowest number of service calls of the pack within the first 25,000 miles (refer to the car service call statistics data provided below).\n\nThis climbs to $325 for 50,000 to 100,000 miles and hits $400 beyond 100,000 miles.\n\nWhile maintenance costs rise as mileage increases in Subarus, they remain relatively affordable compared to other brands. Baja has the lowest average repair bills across its lifespan. The Ascent is most expensive to maintain long-term compared to the three. But even higher-maintenance Subarus remains cost-effective.\n\nProper maintenance and repair of small issues early help minimize major repair costs down the road. But Subarus' reputation for reliability and longevity shines through in the data, no matter the mileage. ",

				"text": "We all want our rides to be reliable and affordable to maintain. \n\nAmong the brands with  an unbeatable reputation for reliability are Toyota and Lexus. But just how reliable are these Japanese brands compared to each other? \n\nLet's crunch the numbers.\n\nAnalysis of car service call statistics reveals that Lexus edges out Toyota slightly when it comes to long-term reliability per mile driven. The average Toyota have over 27,000 defects reported by 25,000 miles. Lexus models have far less at around 2000 reported defects within the same mileage. \n\nFrom the brand model generation search bar:\n\nChoose Toyota and then click “Search for defects by Toyota” on the far right. A graph will come up with the generated data, pulled from useful resources such as nhtsa.gov. \n\n Next, click on the brand model generation search bar and choose Lexus (for the comparison), and then click  “Search for defects by Lexus.” This includes a Lexus bar chart, beside the Toyota in orange. \n\nYou can click “By age” or “Mileage” to get the visual comparison data. \n\nFor our case, we used “Total” defects by “Mileage” to get the below bar chart.\n\n\n\n\nSo, what makes Lexus the king of reliability mile after mile? It comes down to higher-grade components, more stringent quality control, and fewer standard features to break. Lexus also offers things like stainless steel exhausts that Toyota doesn't.\n\nOf course, Toyota still tops all non-luxury brands for longevity. But for that extra dose of bulletproof dependability, Lexus takes the crown. Its ultra-durable build and upscale parts ensure it outlasts its parent company by tens of thousands of miles before repairs are needed.",

				"text": "Reliability Comparison of Toyota Camry vs Honda Accord vs Mazda 6 Based on Statistics\n\nWhen it comes to purchasing a new car, reliability is often one of the top concerns for buyers. After all, no one wants to invest their hard-earned money in a vehicle that will constantly break down or require expensive repairs. In this article, we will compare the reliability of three popular midsize sedans: the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, and Mazda 6, based on statistics.\n\nToyota Camry:\nThe Toyota Camry has long been known for its reliability and durability. According to various reliability studies and consumer reports, the Camry consistently ranks high in terms of reliability. For example, the J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study consistently rates the Camry as one of the most reliable vehicles in its class. Additionally, the Camry has received high scores in the Consumer Reports reliability ratings, with above-average reliability scores for most model years.\n\nHonda Accord:\nThe Honda Accord is another midsize sedan that has built a reputation for reliability over the years. Like the Camry, the Accord consistently receives high marks in reliability studies. The J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study has consistently ranked the Accord as one of the most reliable vehicles in its class. Consumer Reports also rates the Accord highly in terms of reliability, with above-average scores for most model years.\n\nMazda 6:\nWhile the Mazda 6 may not have the same longstanding reputation for reliability as the Camry and Accord, it has made significant strides in recent years. According to various reliability studies, the Mazda 6 has shown improvement in terms of reliability. For example, the J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study has seen the Mazda 6's reliability scores improve over time. However, it is worth noting that the Mazda 6 may still have slightly lower reliability scores compared to the Camry and Accord.\n\nIn terms of specific reliability issues, all three vehicles have their own strengths and weaknesses. However, it is important to note that these issues can vary depending on the model year and specific trim level. It is always recommended to research the reliability of a specific model year and trim level before making a purchase.\n\nIn conclusion, when comparing the reliability of the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, and Mazda 6, all three vehicles have a strong reputation for reliability. The Camry and Accord have consistently ranked high in reliability studies and consumer reports, while the Mazda 6 has shown improvement in recent years. Ultimately, the choice between these three vehicles may come down to personal preference, budget, and specific needs.",
