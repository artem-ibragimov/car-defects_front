A higher rate, as seen with the **Subaru Impreza**, indicates more frequent repairs, which could translate to higher ownership costs over time.\n\n### What should I consider when choosing between these car models?\n\nWhen choosing between these models, consider:\n- **Reliability**: Look at service call rates and common issues.\n- **Cost of ownership**: Factor in potential repair costs.\n- **Personal needs**: Consider features like all-wheel drive or fuel efficiency.\n- **Resale value**: Reliable cars often retain value better.\n\n### Is it worth investing in extended warranties for these cars?\n\nExtended warranties can provide peace of mind, especially for models with higher service call rates like the **Subaru Impreza** and **Mazda 3**. For the **Toyota Corolla** and **Honda Civic**, which are known for reliability, an extended warranty might be less critical but could still be beneficial for unexpected repairs.",
