Looking at the first three years of ownership, the Palisade averages 11 service calls per 10,000 vehicles compared to 15 service calls for the Telluride. However, it's important to note that both vehicles show strong reliability metrics compared to the segment average, and the difference isn't substantial enough to be a decisive factor for most buyers.\n\n### How do service calls trend over time for both vehicles?\n\nBoth SUVs show a similar pattern of reliability over time:\n\n- **Kia Telluride**: 15 â†’ 16 â†’ 15 â†’ 14 â†’ 5 calls per 10,000 vehicles\n- **Hyundai Palisade**: 11 â†’ 12 â†’ 10 â†’ 7 â†’ 2 calls per 10,000 vehicles\n\nInterestingly, both vehicles show improved reliability in later years, with a significant drop in service calls after the fourth year. This could indicate that early production issues are typically resolved during the first few years of ownership.\n\n### What does the service call data tell us about long-term reliability?\n\nThe data shows encouraging trends for both vehicles' long-term reliability. By year 4, both models show a dramatic decrease in service calls, with the Telluride dropping to 5 calls and the Palisade to 2 calls per 10,000 vehicles. This suggests that both vehicles become *more* reliable as they age, contrary to what many might expect. This could be attributed to:\n\n- Initial manufacturing issues being resolved\n- Owners becoming more familiar with their vehicles\n- Proper maintenance schedules being established\n- Early problematic units being addressed under warranty\n\n### Are first-year reliability issues a concern for either model?\n\nFirst-year reliability data shows:\n- Telluride: 15 calls per 10,000 vehicles\n- Palisade: 11 calls per 10,000 vehicles\n\nWhile the Palisade has a slight edge, both vehicles demonstrate respectable first-year reliability figures. These numbers are actually quite good for new model launches, especially considering these are relatively new platforms for both manufacturers.\n\n### How do maintenance costs compare between the Telluride and Palisade?\n\nWhile the service call data doesn't directly address maintenance costs, the frequency of service calls can indicate potential expenses. The Palisade's lower service call rate might suggest slightly lower maintenance costs over time. However, since both vehicles:\n- Share many mechanical components\n- Use similar powertrains\n- Have comparable warranty coverage\nThe actual maintenance costs tend to be very similar between the two models.\n\n### Should the reliability data influence my buying decision between these two SUVs?\n\nWhile reliability should be a factor in your decision, the differences between these models aren't significant enough to make it the *primary* deciding factor. Consider:\n- Both show strong reliability trends\n- Service call differences are relatively minor\n- Both come with excellent warranty coverage\n- Other factors like features, pricing, and personal preference may be more important\n\n### How do these reliability figures compare to other SUVs in the same class?\n\nBoth the Telluride and Palisade demonstrate above-average reliability for their class. The declining service call rates over time are particularly impressive, as many competitors show the opposite trend. This data helps explain why both models have received numerous industry awards and maintain strong resale values.\n\n### What's the significance of the dramatic drop in service calls after year 4?\n\nThe significant decrease in service calls (Telluride to 5 and Palisade to 2 per 10,000 vehicles) after year 4 suggests:\n- Manufacturing processes have been refined\n- Early issues have been addressed through recalls or technical service bulletins\n- Owners who maintain their vehicles properly experience fewer problems\n- Both manufacturers have successfully improved their quality control processes\n\nThis trend is particularly encouraging for those considering long-term ownership of either vehicle.",
