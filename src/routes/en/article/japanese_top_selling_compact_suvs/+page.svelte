	<p>
		Were you aware, that in Japanese top-selling compact SUVs - Toyota Rav4, Honda CR-V, and Mazda
		CX-5 the only Honda CR-V has CVT - continuously variable transmission?
	</p>
	<p>
		The potential buyers might be wondering: how reliable is this kind of transmission? There are
		thousands of questions, answers, and polar opinions in car forums. But letâ€™s be absolutely
		objective here the statistics of car service calls aren't pretty: Compared with concurrents,
		Honda owners have problems with CVT two times more often than others in the first three years of
		use.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, a CVT car is more dynamic and fuel-efficient, but if car reliability is important to
		you, You'd be better off taking a classic automatic transmission.
